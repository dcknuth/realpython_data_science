Following this [data science article](https://realpython.com/python-for-data-analysis)

ds_pipeline.py - The main Python file, you may want to put in a couple break points if using VS Code so you can see prints and plots as things progress

jamesbond.csv - is the data as given from Kaggle, the original

james_bond_data_cleaned.csv - is the cleaned data with renamed columns, mostly as suggested by the article
